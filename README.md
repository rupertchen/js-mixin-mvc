js-mixin-mvc
============

PureMVC inspired MVC framework implemented with mixins.


TODO
----
-   Attribute design to PureMVC
-   Attribute mixin implementation to Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good
    Parts"
-   Describe rationale: unintrusive usage, use whatever style of object
    creation you want, no external dependencies, full unit test coverage
