js-mixin-mvc
============

PureMVC inspired MVC framework implemented with mixins.

Building
--------
The project is built with Node.js and Grunt. Install the Grunt CLI for
convenience.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

With the tools in place, install all project dependencies and run the
default Grunt task.

    npm -d install
    grunt


TODO
----
-   Attribute design to PureMVC
-   Attribute mixin implementation to Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good
    Parts"
-   Describe rationale: unintrusive usage, use whatever style of object
    creation you want, no external dependencies, full unit test coverage
